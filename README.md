# PhotoLab
C program modules for pseudo-Photoshop with purpose of image manipulation
The primary program PhotoLab.c utilizes a makefile to compile with all the other smaller modules of header files (.h) and c files (.c) 
in order to make a cohesive program. 

The final program presents users with a menu, wherre selecting different number options will result in different image "filters" being 
operated. FIlters currently range from black and white, edge detection, shuffling, brightness, mirroring, and hue. These filters are 
applied to a loaded image and saved to a website for viewing.
