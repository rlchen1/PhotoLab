# PhotoLab
C program modules for pseudo-Photoshop program with purpose of image manipulation.
The primary program file PhotoLab_v3.c utilizes a makefile to compile with the component modules consisting of header files (.h) and c files (.c) in order to produce a compilable, cohesive program. 

The final program presents users with a menu, where selecting different number options will result in different image "filters" being 
applied to a loaded image. Filters range from black and white, edge detection, shuffling, brightness, mirroring, hue, rotate/flip, resizing, and saturation. The filters utilize a data structure and pointer system, where the output image is saved to a website for viewing, accesible at https://bondi.eecs/uci/edu/~rlchen1/.
