# PhotoLab
C program modules for pseudo-Photoshop with purpose of image manipulation
The primary program PhotoLab.c utilizes a makefile to compile with all the other smaller modules of header files (.h) and c files (.c) 
in order to make a cohesive program. 

The final program presents users with a menu, where selecting different number options will result in different image "filters" being 
operated. FIlters currently range from black and white, edge detection, shuffling, brightness, mirroring, hue, rotate/flip, resizing, and saturation. These filters are modified using a structure and pointer system and applied to a loaded image where the image is saved to a website for viewing.
